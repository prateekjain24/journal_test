# Health Clarity: Product Concept & User Stories

## 📋 Product Concept

### What is it?
**Health Clarity** is your personal health companion that reveals patterns in your wellbeing through effortless journaling. You speak or type naturally about how you feel, and AI automatically detects symptom-trigger correlations and predictive warnings you'd never notice on your own.

### The Core Problem
People experience recurring health issues but can't connect the dots. "Why do I always feel anxious on Sundays?" "What triggers my migraines?" "Why do I sleep poorly some weeks?" We notice symptoms but lack the pattern recognition to understand our own health.

Traditional solutions fail because:
- **Manual journaling** requires too much discipline and provides no analysis
- **Symptom trackers** force rigid data entry that people abandon
- **Memory alone** is unreliable and biased
- **Doctor visits** rely on incomplete recall

### The Breakthrough Insight
People WANT to understand their health but HATE formal tracking. The solution: Let them journal naturally (like talking to a friend), and AI finds the patterns they'd never spot themselves.

It's **passive wisdom from active living**.

    And I have mentioned "headache" 6 times
    And 5 of those headaches occurred on weekdays
    And all 6 followed mentions of "poor sleep" by 1-2 days

  Scenario: First pattern detection notification
    Given patterns have been analyzed
    When I open the app
    Then I should see a prominent banner: "New pattern detected"
    And the notification should feel exciting, not clinical
    When I click on the notification
    Then I should be taken to the Insights section

  Scenario: Viewing a frequency pattern
    Given I am in the Insights section
    Then I should see a pattern card showing:
      - Pattern type: "Frequency Pattern"
      - Description: "You've logged headaches 6 times in the last 14 days - about 3 times per week"
      - Confidence level: "High confidence"

### Feature: Acting on Insights

```gherkin
Feature: Behavior Change from Insights
  As a user who discovered a pattern
  I want to modify my behavior and track results
  So that I can improve my health outcomes

  Background:
    Given I have discovered a pattern: "Anxiety spikes on Sunday evenings"
    And I want to test if Sunday planning reduces anxiety

  Scenario: Using insights to change behavior
    Given I read the pattern about Sunday anxiety
    When I decide to try Sunday afternoon work prep
    Then I should be able to continue journaling normally
    And the app should track my Sunday entries going forward
    And I don't need to explicitly tell the app I'm experimenting

  Scenario: App notices improvement
    Given I've been testing Sunday planning for 4 weeks
    And I've mentioned "anxiety" only once on Sundays in last month
    And I previously mentioned it 4 times per month
    When I check my Insights
    Then I should see: "Good news! Your Sunday anxiety has improved"
    And I should see comparison: "1 mention in last 4 weeks vs 4 in previous month"
    And I should feel encouraged: "Whatever you're doing seems to be working!"

  Scenario: Experimenting with trigger avoidance
    Given I discovered "Coffee after 3pm correlates with poor sleep"
    When I stop drinking afternoon coffee for 2 weeks
    And I continue journaling
    Then the app should notice reduced "poor sleep" mentions
    And should surface: "Your sleep mentions have improved since you reduced afternoon coffee"

### Feature: Conversational Intelligence (Future)

```gherkin
Feature: Smart Health Companion
  As a regular user
  I want the app to ask relevant follow-up questions
  So that I can provide richer context for pattern detection

  Background:
    Given I am an active user with 20+ entries
    And the app has learned my patterns

  Scenario: Smart follow-up after symptom mention
    Given I enter: "Had a terrible headache today"
    When I submit
    Then the app might ask: "Was this similar to your usual headaches, or different?"
    And I can choose to answer or skip
    If I answer: "Different - more intense"
    Then this detail is added to my entry

  Scenario: Contextual memory
    Given yesterday I mentioned: "Feeling really anxious"
    And today I enter: "Feeling better"
    When the app processes my entry
    Then it understands "better" means "less anxious"
    And it tracks this as improvement

  Scenario: Proactive observation
    Given I've mentioned "dairy" 3 times
    And I've mentioned "stomach issues" after each within 4 hours
    When I submit a 4th entry with dairy
    Then the app might note: "I've noticed stomach discomfort tends to follow dairy. Might be worth tracking."
    And I can acknowledge or dismiss this observation
```

    And I should be able to correct if wrong

  Scenario: Handling vague entries
    Given I enter: "Not feeling great today"
    When I submit
    Then the app might gently prompt: "Can you say a bit more about what's not feeling great?"
    And I can choose to elaborate or skip
    And the entry is saved regardless

  Scenario: Complex entry with multiple symptoms
    Given I enter: "Headache behind left eye, nauseous, sensitive to light. Also had trouble sleeping last night - kept waking up. Might be stress from work deadline tomorrow."
    When I submit
    Then the app should extract:
      - Symptoms: "headache (left eye)", "nauseous", "light sensitivity", "sleep disturbance"
      - Possible trigger: "stress", "work deadline"
      - Sleep quality: "poor (frequent waking)"
    And should link these as potentially related

    Then I should see positive feedback: "Entry saved. Thanks for checking in with yourself."
    And I should see what was understood from my entry
    And I should feel productive, not just data collection

  Scenario: Micro-insights before patterns
    Given I have 5 entries
    And I've mentioned "tired" 3 times
    When I check my progress
    Then I should see: "You've mentioned 'tired' 3 times in 5 entries"
    And I should see: "This repetition is worth noticing"
    And I should feel the app is paying attention

  Scenario: Progress tracking
    Given I have 7 entries
